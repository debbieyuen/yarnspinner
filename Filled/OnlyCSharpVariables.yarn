// Every time we want to get or change the value of the player coins we ask C#
// C# manages the variables

The player has {get_player_coins()} coin(s).
-> I would like another coin please.
    // The player coins changes as the dialogue changes
    <<if add_player_coins(1)>>
        Sure thing, boss.
    <<else>>
        Sorry, no can do.
    <<endif>>
